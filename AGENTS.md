# Project Working Gate — /home/ubuntu/code/english

This repo follows the workspace-level OMX/autonomous-agent instructions. The following project-local gate is mandatory and exists because this app has repeatedly appeared "done" while the running Next dev server or live route was still broken.

## GPT/Codex mistake-reduction harness

- Keep autonomous execution as the default for clear, low-risk, reversible work; do not stop to ask permission when the next step is obvious.
- Before changing code, state only the assumptions that materially affect scope, behavior, data, or user-visible outcome. If an assumption could cause the wrong change, ask one concise clarifying question before editing.
- If multiple plausible interpretations would lead to different diffs, surface the interpretations instead of silently choosing one. If the difference is low-risk and reversible, proceed with the smallest assumption and name it briefly.
- Prefer the simplest change that satisfies the latest request. Do not add abstractions, configurability, dependencies, generalized error handling, or adjacent cleanup unless the task directly requires them.
- Before finishing an implementation, run an overcomplication check: if the solution is materially longer or more indirect than the behavior requires, simplify it before verification.
- Make surgical edits only. Every changed line should trace to the latest user request or to cleanup made necessary by that change.
- If you notice adjacent issues, mention them separately instead of fixing them silently.
- Convert vague requests into verifiable goals before editing: identify the affected surface, expected behavior, non-goals when relevant, and the smallest check that proves completion.
- For bug fixes, prefer a failing or targeted test that reproduces the issue before the fix when practical; for refactors, preserve behavior and verify before and after when coverage exists.
- If a change starts becoming larger than expected, pause and report the tradeoff rather than broadening scope silently.

## Scope discipline — do only what was asked

- Do not broaden a user request into adjacent UI, copy, behavior, schema, or test changes unless the user explicitly asks for that broader change.
- When the user asks to adjust one UI element, change only that element. Do not also change nearby controls, ordering, labels, colors, or layouts because they seem related.
- If a requested change reveals an adjacent issue, mention it separately instead of fixing it silently.
- Preserve existing behavior and placement by default; only alter behavior that is directly required by the latest user instruction.
- When correcting a mistaken change, restore the previous behavior exactly unless the user gives a new replacement direction.

## PRD lifecycle discipline

- When implementation starts for a tracked PRD item, move that feature folder to `docs/prd/active/<feature>/` and move the matching tracker item in `docs/prd/future-work.md` to `Active` in the same branch/PR.
- Do not leave in-progress implementation work under `docs/prd/backlog/`; backlog is only for candidate, planned, or pull-ready work that is not currently being implemented.
- If a PR is open for the implementation, the PRD/tracker must say `Active` until the work is merged/verified or explicitly paused/returned to backlog.
- When the work is finished and verified, move the feature folder to `docs/prd/complete/<feature>/` and record changed files, verification commands, and remaining risks in `docs/prd/future-work.md`.

## Working tree isolation on request

- If the user explicitly asks to proceed with a separated working tree, create or use a separate `git worktree` before making task changes.
- Do not mix that requested work with the current working tree's uncommitted edits; keep the isolated worktree on its own branch/path and report the path being used.
- If a separate worktree cannot be created or used, stop before task edits and report the blocker instead of continuing in the original tree.
- When integrating separated work, merge or raise the PR toward the `dev` branch by default. Do not target `main`, `origin/main`, or a release branch unless the user explicitly says so.
- Only target `main` when the user explicitly instructs to put the work on `main`; otherwise keep integration directed at `dev`.
- Before any merge/push handoff, state the source branch/worktree and confirm the target branch is `dev`.
- After a feature/fix branch has been successfully integrated into the target branch and pushed, delete the merged source branch both locally and remotely when it is no longer needed; do not leave stale task branches behind.

## Database and Supabase environment boundaries

- Treat `dev` and `main` as using separate Supabase/database environments unless the user explicitly says otherwise.
- Current environment mapping:
  - `dev` / Codex Supabase MCP / `.env.local` points to Supabase project `uixpyibcpleuwsgemdno`.
  - `main` / production DB / `.env.main.local` points to Supabase project `ccawzrrkxuirrwvaecvw`.
- The currently configured Codex Supabase MCP connection is scoped to the **dev** Supabase project, not the main/production database.
- Before reading or writing hosted Supabase data, state which environment is being targeted (`dev` MCP / `.env.local` or `main` / `.env.main.local`) and verify the project ref/host.
- Do not assume a migration or data fix applied through the dev MCP has also been applied to main/production; apply or verify each environment separately.
- When promoting code from `dev` to `main`, separately confirm whether any schema/data changes must be applied to the main/production database.
- For any hosted Supabase write containing Korean or other non-ASCII user text, verify text integrity after the write by querying the target database and comparing saved fields to the intended payload. This is mandatory for `expression_days.raw_input`, `expression_days.source_note`, `expressions.korean_prompt`, and ingestion draft payload fields. Do not report completion if saved text contains replacement output such as `???` or differs from the intended text.
- When sending Korean or other non-ASCII payloads from PowerShell into WSL/stdin, explicitly force UTF-8 first (`$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false)` and `[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false)`), or use a verified UTF-8 file/script path. Default shell pipe encoding is not acceptable for production or dev data writes.
- Manage schema/data migrations Flyway-style through `supabase/migrations/*.sql` plus the `scripts/db-migrations.mjs` ledger runner, not ad-hoc SQL Editor execution.
  - Use `npm run db:status:dev` / `npm run db:status:main` to see which migration files are applied, pending, baselined, or checksum-mismatched.
  - Use `npm run db:baseline:dev` only to record already-applied SQL Editor migrations before the runner takes ownership; do not baseline new migrations instead of applying them.
  - Use `npm run db:migrate:dev` for dev migration application. For main/production, run status first and require an explicit production confirmation path (`-- --confirm-production`) before applying.
  - Never edit an already-applied migration file; create a new timestamped migration so the ledger checksum remains meaningful.
  - If emergency SQL Editor execution is unavoidable, immediately add the matching migration file and baseline the ledger in the same environment before claiming completion.
- For schema/RLS migrations, verify both databases when relevant:
  - service-role/admin reads can confirm tables, rows, folders, and RPC existence;
  - an authenticated-user read smoke should confirm RLS actually allows `content_folders`, `expression_days`, and `expressions` where applicable;
  - do not claim a migration is live in an environment unless that environment was checked directly.

## Local dev server access

- When the user asks to run, open, or restart the dev server, bind it to `0.0.0.0` unless they explicitly request localhost-only.
- Verify both local and external-IP access when possible: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` and the machine's reachable LAN/WSL/container IP such as `http://172.22.48.149:3000/`.
- Do not report the server as open if it only listens on `127.0.0.1` and the user is expected to access it from an external IP.

## Mandatory end-of-task working gate

Before reporting any implementation, UI, route, server action, schema, or runtime-affecting task as complete:

1. **Classify the affected surface first.**
   - UI, route, navigation, server action, API, auth, persistence, scheduling, or schema changes are runtime-facing and require live app verification of the affected path.
   - Pure library/helper changes that do not alter routing or rendering still require targeted unit/integration coverage and a minimal affected-route smoke check when any route imports the changed code.
   - Test-only, docs-only, comments-only, or type-only edits do not require a live route check unless they change runtime code, build config, environment handling, generated assets, or dev-server behavior.
   - If the change category is mixed or unclear, treat it as runtime-facing and run the live route check.

2. **Run the command-level verification checklist appropriate to the change.**
   - Minimum for runtime code changes: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, the relevant targeted test(s), and a running-app check of the affected route/action.
   - Use targeted tests first when available, for example `npm test -- <test-file>` or the relevant project script such as `npm run test:node`, `npm run test:components`, or `npm run test:e2e -- --grep <pattern>`.
   - For broad, cross-cutting, release-boundary, build-config, dependency, or routing changes, run `npm run build` and prefer `npm run verify` when time and environment allow.
   - For schema/RLS-sensitive work, also run the repo's schema/RLS verification path when applicable: `npm run verify:rls`.
   - If a required command cannot run, final reporting must state the exact command, failure/blocker, and what remains unverified.

3. **Verify the actual affected behavior, not only tests.**
   - Identify the route/action/screen changed by the task.
   - Exercise it with the running app when possible (`curl`, Playwright, or a browser-level/e2e check), including the exact route that the user is likely to open.
   - For UI queue/navigation work, verify the post-click state and the redirected/reloaded route.
   - For pure logic changes used by a route, smoke-check the most direct importing route after targeted tests pass.

4. **Check the running dev server health.**
   - Start or restart the dev server with an external bind when user-visible verification is needed: `npm run dev -- --hostname 0.0.0.0`.
   - Check local access with `curl -I http://127.0.0.1:3000/<affected-route>` or a route-appropriate `curl` request.
   - When external access matters, also check the machine/container IP route, for example `curl -I http://172.22.48.149:3000/<affected-route>` if that IP is reachable in the current environment.
   - If `.next` was deleted, `npm run clean:runtime` was run, `next build` was run, or chunks may have changed while `next dev` is still running, restart the dev server before final response.
   - Inspect the dev-server output for `InternalServerError`, `500`, `Cannot find module`, missing chunk errors, schema errors, or failed server actions.
   - Do not say the task is done while the user's visible app is returning Internal Server Error.

5. **Schema/migration gate.**
   - If code reads or writes a newly introduced database column/table/policy, verify the matching migration exists and state whether it has been applied to the target database.
   - If the target DB may not have the migration, treat that as a blocker or explicitly provide the migration/apply step; do not claim live behavior works from local memory-store tests alone.

6. **Evidence in final response.**
   - Final reports must list the changed files and the affected surface classification used for verification.
   - Final reports must include the exact commands/checks run and their results, including the route/action URL or Playwright flow used for live verification when required.
   - Final reports must include the commands/checks that prove the app actually ran for the affected path.
   - If live verification is impossible, say exactly what prevented it and what remains unverified.

Minimum expected verification for code changes remains: lint, typecheck, relevant tests, and build when relevant. This gate adds the extra requirement that changed user-facing paths must be exercised against a healthy running app before claiming completion, while docs-only/test-only/type-only changes may use the narrower verification path above.

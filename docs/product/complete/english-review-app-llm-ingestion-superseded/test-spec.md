# Test Spec: English Review App — LLM-Assisted Lesson Ingestion MVP

## Source

- Tracker: `docs/product/future-work.md`.
- Lifecycle folder: `complete`; superseded test spec retained as historical context only unless a new tracker item revives this direction.
- PRD: `docs/product/complete/english-review-app-llm-ingestion-superseded/prd.md`
- Implementation plan: `docs/product/complete/english-review-app-llm-ingestion-superseded/implementation-plan.md`
- Rollback checkpoint: git commit `18440a0`

## Quality Gates

Implementation is complete only when:

1. Lint passes.
2. Typecheck passes.
3. Unit tests pass.
4. Integration tests pass.
5. Build passes.
6. Mobile e2e passes at 390×844.
7. LLM ingestion payload validation passes.
8. Draft preview can be revised multiple times without inserting records.
9. Lesson insertion happens only after explicit approval.
10. Lesson insertion persists to Supabase or verified test store.
11. Owner-scoped RLS passes for all new tables.
12. User memo/confusion note editing persists.
13. Review modes hide answers before reveal.
14. No public no-auth ingestion endpoint exists.

## Test Matrix

| Area | Test Type | Required Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Ingestion payload schema | Unit | Valid lesson payload accepted; malformed payload rejected. |
| LLM normalization | Unit/static | Required fields exist for each study item. |
| Draft preview | Unit/integration | Draft is created and shown without inserting reviewable records. |
| Draft revision | Unit/integration | User feedback updates the draft and preserves prior context. |
| Approval gate | Unit/integration/security | Non-approval feedback does not insert; explicit save approval inserts. |
| Insert lesson | Integration | Lesson, items, and examples inserted atomically after approval. |
| Raw input traceability | Integration | Raw user input stored on lesson and/or ingestion run. |
| Owner scope | Integration/security | User A cannot see or mutate User B lessons/items/examples. |
| RLS | SQL/container | Select/insert/update/delete policies pass for lessons, study_items, study_examples, ingestion_runs. |
| Lesson list | E2E | Mobile user sees LLM-added lesson grouped by date/source. |
| Item detail | E2E/component | Meaning, nuance, structure, examples, memo fields render. |
| Memo editing | E2E/integration | User memo and confusion note save and survive refresh. |
| Recall review | E2E/component | Meaning-to-expression and expression-to-meaning reveal modes hide answer first. |
| Review status | Integration/e2e | Marking updates status, last_reviewed_at, review_count. |
| Safety | Static/security | No unauthenticated public insert route; unapproved drafts do not become study items; destructive LLM actions blocked or absent. |

## Acceptance Criteria Mapping

### AC-001 — LLM can draft and revise a lesson before saving

Verification:

- Given natural-language lesson input and normalized JSON payload, validation succeeds.
- Draft action creates a preview that is not visible as reviewable study material.
- User revision feedback changes the draft without inserting lesson/items.
- Multiple revision turns preserve the intended lesson context.

### AC-001B — LLM inserts only after explicit approval

Verification:

- Ambiguous positive feedback such as `좋네` does not insert.
- Revision requests such as `예문 더 쉽게 바꿔줘` do not insert.
- Explicit approval such as `이대로 앱에 넣어줘` inserts one lesson and its study items.
- Examples are associated with the correct items.
- App displays the inserted lesson after approval.

### AC-002 — App is review-first, not input-first

Verification:

- Home prioritizes review/recent lessons.
- Heavy manual card creation is removed, hidden, or de-emphasized.
- Main nav points to lessons/review, not manual card entry.

### AC-003 — Personal notes are editable

Verification:

- User can edit `user_memo`.
- User can edit `confusion_note`.
- Edits update `updated_at` and persist after refresh.

### AC-004 — Active recall works

Verification:

- Review prompt can show Korean meaning/nuance while hiding English expression.
- Review prompt can show English expression while hiding meaning.
- Reveal interaction exposes the answer.
- Marking confidence persists.

### AC-005 — RLS/Auth safety holds

Verification:

- Unauthenticated users cannot access data.
- User A can manage own lessons/items/examples.
- User A cannot manage User B data.
- LLM ingestion does not create unowned rows.

## Suggested Commands

```bash
node --version
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
npm run verify:rls
```

## Manual QA

- Tell the LLM a sample lesson with `have to` and `I am used to`.
- Confirm the LLM shows a draft instead of saving immediately.
- Ask for one revision, such as easier examples.
- Confirm no app lesson appears before approval.
- Explicitly approve saving.
- Confirm the app shows a lesson page with both expressions.
- Confirm each expression has Korean meaning, nuance, structure, examples, and memo fields.
- Add a user memo and refresh.
- Run meaning-to-expression recall.
- Mark one item confusing.
- Confirm confusing item appears first later.

## Known Test Gaps to Resolve During Implementation

- Need exact implementation choice for LLM ingestion path before final e2e can be written.
- Live Supabase verification requires configured credentials; local RLS container test should remain available.
